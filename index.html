            <blockquote> Hey you, don't watch that, watch this!
This is the heavy heavy monster sound
The nuttiest sound around
So if you've come in off the street
And you're beginning to feel the heat
Well listen buster
You better start to move your feet
To the rockin'est, rocksteady beat
Of Madness</p>

        <p>As you can probably tell I've never been one for Sport so I decided to make this site as the one's who like sport will realise it's currently the Euros.
    and well as much as I am a Europhile. The Euros and most sport in genral does nothing for me so I thought I would provide much needed content to kindred spirits as well as recomend viewing of other content</p>
